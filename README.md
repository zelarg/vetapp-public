# Free Veterinary application
Modern scalable application to manage any-size veterinary practice.

## Download
Download here: [VetApp v1.0.1](https://github.com/zelarg/vetapp-public/releases/download/v1.0.0/vetapp-client.exe)

## Install
The application has 2 separate parts - **Server** and **Client**. Both can be on same computer, or they can be separated. For larger practices with multiple work-stations, we suggest to separate them and install server on always up & running computer. For small practices, both parts can sit on same PC.

1. Download installation package first to your main computer, and install the application there (**Client** and also **Server** part - prompted after Client installation finishes)
2. If you need to use multiple work-stations in practice, install only **Client** part on rest of them.
